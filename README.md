# ROS
The world's first fully featured open-source OS

Hello world! We are CIAT (Charity In All Things) and this is the ROS (Responsible Operating System). Our goal here is to work off of existing open source code, clean it up, implement some of our own ideas, and make it more understandable and useable overall.

You can find us on reddit at r/CIAT on discord with the invite link https://discord.gg/xxnAAme and on Twitter @CIAT_Official.

This Git is for development on the ROS. If you'd like to try to change the world and maybe get paid along the way you're in the right place. Our goal to reach full development of this operating system is to raise $1,500,000 to $5,000,000 and split that evenly with everyone who contributes according to how much they contributed to each feature. The ETA's and values aren't set in stone until we raise donations, but you can take them as rough estimates as to how much of the funding will be given to each feature. As lead designer and owner of my non-profit, I will not be taking any portion of the donations, and none of the funds raised will be used for personal or buisness development. I want this to be a project run by the community, for the community, so all the profits should go to the community.

There isn't a lot here right because we're just getting started. Our first goal is to find an open source operating system to work off of. It must be easy to work with and robust enough to build our foundation with. Meaning, the code needs to be well commented, well organized, and easy to expand upon. We also plan on changing much of the code ourselves to make it more readable and understandable. We want everything we release to be easy for even a novice to understand and work with. If you'd like to contribute, please reach out on our discord to become a part of our open development team. We need all kinds of help, not just coding, so please don't be shy!

If you do plan on submitting code to the project, we ask that you please follow a few guide lines.

1. Please comment all of your code, from beginning to end.
2. Put the full name of all contributors and a contact email in the first comment of any contributed code.
3. Start every code block (ex: main, functions, loops, branching logic, ext.) with a discription of what it is and what it does.
4. Functions with any input or output should state what those variables are, what they're for, and where else they are used a comment above the function.
5. Use descriptive variable names (no x, or y, unless they are actual coordinates.)
6. Please try to follow the formatting of existing code, if we decide to change our formatting, we'll do it all at once.

If you have any questions feel free to ask us on any of our platforms.
